# ListoDo
## Todo app - Frontend built with React

This is the frontend for a Todo App built using React, which interacts with an API I developed in a separate project (see repository 'tasks-server').

## Name


**ListoDo** is a combination of the spanish word "Listo", which means "ready" and the english word "Do", as in taking action. Together, they reflect the app's goal: helping you to be ready to do what matters.


## Features


- View, create, edit and delete Tasks.
- Optimistic UI updated using React hooks.
- Task data is fetched from the backend API.


## Tools & Technologies:


- React
- JavaScript
- API Integration: Communicates with a backend API to manage the tasks


## Backend


The backend API that powers this app is located in the task-server repository.
