# Task app - Frontend built with React


The frontend for a todo app built with **React** to practice React and also the interaction with an API that I built (see repository 'tasks-server').


## Tools used:


- React
- JavaScript


## TODO:
- Add the ability to change and delete a task
- Hide the sidebar on small screens and show a menu when the menu icon is clicked.
- Projects: add them to the sidebar (menu) and create a project component.
